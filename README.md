# Accoutrement Etc.

These are just assorted functions and mixins I use on my projects.
Maybe some of them will develop in to more legit Things,
but for now thye are just normal things.

If they are documented,
that's merely an excercise in good code practice,
and doesn't imply that they are useful.

Some of these things are stolen and re-worked from other projects,
notably [toolkit][] by [snugug][] and [canarymason][]
who are very smart.
